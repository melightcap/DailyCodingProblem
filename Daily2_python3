##Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
##For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

def product(lst):
    new = []
    
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        result = 1
        for item in lst:
            if item != lst[i]:
                result *= item
        new.append(result)

    return new

print(product([1,2,3,4,5]))
print(product([3,2,1]))
